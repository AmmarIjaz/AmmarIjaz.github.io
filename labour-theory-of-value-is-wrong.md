# Labour Theory of Value is Wrong

Imagine you're an alien who finds themselves in market day in western Europe in the 1700s, and you're trying to make sense of the activity in front of you. You see these strange bipedal creatures—the most intelligent on this planet, apparently—handing over what appear to be metals and receiving a diverse range of things for them after a suitable period of mouth flapping, which your universal translator tells you is "haggling".

Using your advanced technology, you make yourself look like one of these creatures—so many protruding bones in their major face hole!—and quiz the first few people as they leave. They traded metals for various forms of plant matter, which they claim they need to survive. Aha! They must use the metal pieces as tokens in exchange for things of biological necessity! Then the creature which took those metal pieces can use them to buy biological necessity items that _they_ need, so the tokens flow around their community. Hooray! You can return home now!

You stop one more individual just to confirm your theory who had just traded the metal for carbon arranged in a crystaline structure they call "diamonds". Even with the hard protruding bones in your "mouth", you can't imagine how these creatures could consume such a thing. You ask why they traded what appeared to be a large quantity of metal for it and they say "cause it looks nice" before hurrying away.

Huh.

It seems like you'll be on this smelly planet for a while longer…

For centuries, there's been attempts to explain the human phenomenon of trade under the heading of "value", as a suitably generic enough term to cover everything humans are willing to trade—food, water, clothing, etc.

The first major theory of value locates it in precious metals as having an "intrinsic" or "objective" source of value. This drives Mercantilism, which is an economic paradigm which emphasised increasing specie (hard currency eg gold, silver, etc.) in-flows and reduce out-flows. This theory also drives colonialism and, in particular, the efforts to ensure the colony's raw materials are sent back to the colonial centre for refinement and manufacturing, at which point the value-added goods are sent back to the colony for sale as a way to keep specie in the metropole.

After the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment hit, a group of (mostly) French thinkers were deeply influenced by recent discoveries in biology, in particular the circulatory system, to create one of the first well-developed theories of economics called Physiocracy (1). They allowed some space for labour, but mainly emphasised the role of _land_ as the true source of all value. At a time when the vast majority of the economy is agrarian in nature, this is not an unreasonable thought. Food grows out of the land, water comes out of the land, raw materials for clothing come out of the land (whether grown directly or fed to animals to use their skins/furs), precious metals come out of the land, and so on.

Adam Smith, riding high after the success of _The Theory of Moral Sentiments_ (1759) spent time in France and got to know prominent Physiocrats, which deeply influenced his own _The Wealth of Nations_ (1776). His book inaugurated the classical phase of economics, which includes thinkers such as Karl Marx and David Ricardo. Classical economists went back to John Locke's _Second Treatise on Government_ (1689) where he offers a Biblical justification of labour being the source of value:

> God, when he gave the world in common to all mankind, commanded man also to labour, and the penury of his condition required it of him. God and his reason commanded him to subdue the earth, i.e. improve it for the benefit of life, and therein lay out something upon it that was his own, his labour. He that in obedience to this command of God, subdued, tilled and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it something that was his property, which another had no title to, nor could without injury take from him.

However, the labour theory of value (LTV) runs into a number of problems as a descriptive theory:
* As David Ricardo points out, wine that is merely kept in barrels for additional years becomes more valuable without any labour being added to it.
* How do things lose value? Is labour put into its production somehow "evaporating" out of, say, a loaf of bread that's spoiling?
* It's immediately clear that the labour theory of value isn't a theory of _prices_, and Smith proposes "value in use" and "value in exchange" to discuss this issue. He also discusses the water-diamond paradox: "Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarcely anything; scarcely anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarcely any use-value; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it." (_The Wealth of Nations_)

The solution comes in the form of a Kuhnian revolution that emerged initially from the Austrian school in the late 1800s—the Marginal Revolution. In contrast to classical economists seeking an "intrinsic" or "objective" theory of value, it argued for a subjective theory of value—beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.

Another way to think about it is to see the quest for an intrinsic/objective theory of value as committing the Fallacy of the Aristotelian Essence, as John Vervaeke has coined it, which is an attempt to find a list of necessary and sufficient conditions. For example, there is a persistent mis-perception about the theory of evolution that "fitness" is certain qualities eg speed, strength, toughness, etc. In fact, the theory of evolution is the theory of how to _find/create_ fitness, not a theory of fitness itself. Similarly, relevance/salience has no stable, essential qualities so Vervaeke's theory is one of relevance _realisation_, not relevance itself.

The subjective theory of value, when combined with marginalism, neatly solves the issues the LTV above can't _and_ provides a theory of prices to boot.

You may have noticed I played a bit of slight-of-hand there. 

When we ask why something has happened, we use "why" to ask (at least) two different questions: "what is the moral justification for this?" (what I call moral responsibility) and "what are the causal factors for this?" (causal responsibility).

I've set this essay up as a purely causal/descriptive exercise and evaluated the various theories of value as a scientific exercise, asking "does this theory explain the phenomenon better than the alternatives?" as you would between Newtonion mechanics and Einstenian mechanics.

But thinkers like Locke and Marx were political philosophers engaged in normative projects about what _should_ be, not a descriptive one about what _is_. It is entirely coherent to say "labour _should_ be the basis for all value" but it's clearly inaccurate to say "labour _is_ the basis of all value".

However, I think there is a persuasive argument for the morality of allowing heterogenuous subjective values for goods and prices to be based on supply and ddemand (rather than based on some mystical sense of "value" imbued into the item), most clearly explicated by Joseph Heath in the Rawlsian tradition.
