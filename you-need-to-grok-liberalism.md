# You need to grok liberalism

You swing by my place to hang out and find five people there, then I explain that we're going to vote on disassembling you for your organs because I need a kidney, Carol needs a liver, Romesh needs skin, etc.[^2] You (obviously) vote against, but the majority votes for so you lose. Sucks to be you, worst system except for all the others, blah blah blah...but this is entirely legitimate because we voted on it.

Why is this illegitimate?

Despite living in a liberal democracy, most members can give a reasonably coherant definition of the "democracy" half--voting or something--but will struggle with the "liberal" half, which is weird cause most modern liberal democracies have been liberal a lot longer than they've been democracies[^1]. In fact, liberalism "won" so thoroughly that most people's experience of the term is likely as a term of abuse.

The "liberal" half is really, really important though.



None of this is to say you should _believe_ in liberalism, but not understanding it--and its limitations--thoroughly is like 

[^1]: If you measure democracy by universal suffrage then most didn't extend the vote to all adults until the 20th century.

[^2]: Don't worry though--we're gonna hook you up to the latest artificial organs and you'll survive but just be bed-bound for the rest of your life.
