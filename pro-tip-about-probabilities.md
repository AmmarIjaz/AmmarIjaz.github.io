Understand Probabilities Easier by Converting to Natural Frequencies
====================================================================

Probability statements (eg .43 or 70%) are confusing af. A handy mental trick to grok probabilities from _Reckoning with Risk_: translate probabilities into Natural Frequencies.

E.g. "The statement 'There is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow' is a probability statement about a single event: it will either rain or [it won't].* Single-Event Probabilities are a steady source of miscommunicationâ€¦"

What does 30% mean? A third of people surveyed think it'll rain 30% of the day, another third think it'll rain over 30% of the area, and a third think it rains on 30% of days like tomorrow.**

Some people also think, "oh it's less than 50%, so it's probably not going to rain" and plan to go to the beach.

An easier way to think about it is to convert it to Natural Frequencies (30% becomes 30 out of 100 or 3 out of 10 by chopping off extra 0s) and then adding a reference class _before_ the probability:

Out of the 10 possible tomorrows, it's going to rain in 3 of them.

I usually visualize them as 10 doorways lined up next to each other like portals to alternate futures. I can see it raining through 3 of them and it's sunny/overcast in the other 7. I don't know which doorway I'll be through tomorrow.

A quick refresh on the math:

42% chance = 42 out of 100 possibilities

The rule with < 1% is to move the decimal point to the right until it's no longer a decimal,  while adding a 0 to 100 for each space you moved to the right. E.g.:

0.2% = 2 out of a 1000 = 1 out of 500 (after dividing both sides by 2)
0.0001% = 1 out of 1 million = 6 people in the GTA, for example

* Side-note: it turns out meteorologists are pretty much the only prediction professionals that are at all accurate, mainly because they provide error bars. On 3 out of every 10 days they give a 30% chance of rain, it rains.

** The "correct" answer is the last one.

tl;dr - Thinking of probabilities in terms of Natural Frequencies eliminates a bunch of common probability/statistics fallacies and makes it much easier to reason about the future.

Previous version was confusing so trying again.

Reckoning with Risk is a pretty readable guide, however if you want the denser--but still readable--journal article version, you can read it here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC200816/
