Pro-Tip About Probabilities

A handy mental trick I picked up from _Reckoning with Risk_: translate probabilities into Natural Frequencies.

E.g. "The statement 'There is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow' is a probability statement about a single event: it will either rain or not rain tomorrow. Single event probabilities are a steady source of miscommunicationâ€¦"

Many people think, "oh it's less than 50% so it's probably not going to rain" and visualize tomorrow as a sunny day.

The "correct" answer is that on 3 out of 10 days that meteorologists give a 30% (3 in 10) chance of raining, it rains. As a side-note, it turns out meteorologists are pretty much the only prediction professionals that are at all accurate, mainly because they provide error bars.

Quick refresh on the math:
42% chance = 42 out of 100

The rule with < 1% is to move the decimal point to the right until it's no longer a decimal, and add a 0 to 100 for each space you moved to the right.

0.2% = 2 out of a 1000 = 1 out of 500
0.0001% = 1 out of 1 million = 6 people in the GTA, for example

Thinking of probabilities in terms of Natural Frequencies eliminates a bunch of common probability/statistics fallacies and makes it much easier to reason about the future. I like to imagine probabilities as literal open doors to different alternate futures in front of me.
