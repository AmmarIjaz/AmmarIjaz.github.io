Understand Probabilities by Converting to Natural Frequencies

Previous version was confusing so trying again.

Probability statements (eg .3 or 30% chance of something) are confusing af. A handy mental trick to grok probabilities I picked up from _Reckoning with Risk_: translate probabilities into Natural Frequencies.

E.g. "The statement 'There is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow' is a probability statement about a single event: it will either rain or [it won't].* Single-Event Probabilities are a steady source of miscommunication…"

What does 30% mean? A third of people surveyed think it'll rain 30% of the day, another third think it'll rain over 30% of the area, and a third think it rains on 30% of days like tomorrow.

Some people also think, "oh it's less than 50%, so it's probably not going to rain" and plan to go to the beach.

An easier way to think about it is to convert it to Natural Frequencies (30% becomes 30 out of 100 or 3 out of 10 by chopping the extra 0s off) and then adding a reference class _before_ the probability:

Out of the 10 possible tomorrows, it's going to rain in 3 of them.

I usually visualize them as 10 doorways lined up next to each other like portals. I can see it raining through 3 of them and it's sunny/overcast in the other 7. I don't know which doorway I'll be through tomorrow.

That's a simple example, so let's look at a more complex one, but first--a quick refresh on the math:

42% chance = 42 out of 100

The rule with < 1% is to move the decimal point to the right until it's no longer a decimal,  while adding a 0 to 100 for each space you moved to the right.

0.2% = 2 out of a 1000 = 1 out of 500 (by dividing both sides by 2)
0.0001% = 1 out of 1 million = 6 people in the GTA, for example

To the example!

The probability of dying from COVID-19 is 0.2% for 30-39 year olds. That seems pretty low, but I don't know what to do with it. Let's convert it to Natural Frequencies using above math and put the reference class first:

Out of every 500 30-39 year olds in Ontario that got tested and were positive for COVID-19, one of them dies.

That's…not great odds. I'm not particularly inclined to play Russian Roulette with a gun with 500 chambers. So, I've changed my behaviour significantly to limit the risk of catching it or passing it on to someone who dies.

tl;dr - Thinking of probabilities in terms of Natural Frequencies eliminates a bunch of common probability/statistics fallacies and makes it much easier to reason about the future.

* As a side-note, it turns out meteorologists are pretty much the only prediction professionals that are at all accurate, mainly because they provide error bars. Don't even get my started on economists or stock folk.

Reckoning with Risk is a pretty readable guide, however if you want the denser--but still readable--journal article version, you can read it here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC200816/
