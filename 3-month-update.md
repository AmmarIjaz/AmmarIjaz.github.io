I haven't had a hug in 3 months.

I've never had to sacrifice for the greater good before.

I took 3000 photos a month for two years. When I discovered photography, I found a way of connecting with people I felt so cut off from. Putting the lens between us paradoxically thinned the glass wall I feel with everyone.

It forced me to pay attention to the fleeting expression, the fragile present. Going through the photos later, I learned about friends I thought I knew well. I felt less alone.

I packed my camera away today.

The last three months have been _hard_. Despite all the jokes about being forced to staying home and watching netflix, I've been suffering.

I've been cycling between Down Weeks and Up Weeks for three months. In my Down Weeks, I've reached new heights of anxiety and new depths of depression. My OCD is getting worse and I've started to show symptoms of agoraphobia. I'm irritable at stupid, little things and I've spent hours numbing out re-watching the same old comfort TV shows (Community, anyone?).

I've been grieving my old life. I've been grieving the dead. I've been grieving those who will die. I've been grieving the destroyed dreams. I've been grieving those who's lives are being destroyed right now.

I know I'm in an Up Week when I have the energy to cry.

And the solution is so simple, so easy. A drink with a friend or an evening with a partner. But I can't.

I'm sacrificing for the greater good—to save the lives of strangers. I don't want to give it to someone who gives it to someone who gives it to someone who dies. I don't want to be a link in the chain of transmission that kills someone.

So, I stay home. I've left the house 8 times in 3 months.

I've never been so alone in my life.

I've never felt so connected to every other person in my city or my world.




That statement sounds like such a cliché. Worse, it sounds like a cliché you apply to other people. Firefighters, doctors, soldiers, nurses—"heroes".


My OCD is getting worse. I'm washing my hands more frequently than every before. Handling anything from The Outside leads to at least two minutes of handwashing.

The first wave of tragedies is hitting. Alongside the dead, there's the relationships that are flying apart or simply falling apart. Some of them are withering under the strain of the pandemic, some under the inability to be together, and some that were simply too young to have put down roots to weather this storm.

This pandemic turned many relationships into long-distance relationships overnight, with a whole new set of challenges.

Irritability

Numbing out

Birthday




I put my sports coats away. Won't be wearing them anytime soon.

I've been putting away the trappings of my old life.



My life has been very hard, but it's largely been free of duty to the greater good.

I'm also ashamed of it.

Not sure I like how this is going:
My dad grew up wearing more holes than cloth. Poverty in a third-world country is completely unlike poverty anywhere else. For him to take us from there to comfortably middle class in Canada in one generation is, for me, equivalent to winning the lottery.

It's also been incredibly hard. I had to sacrifice a lot. I sacrificed for my future and my family's future. But I've never had to sacrifice for so many before.
