# Star Trek's replicators won't end money and bring about post-scarcity

To explain why, we need to take a short detour through how economics talks about Goods. Don't worry--there's no math and I've used capitals to indicate terms with specific meanings within economics.

There's a lot of ways to talk about Goods, which (confusingly) includes services.

You can talk about physical goods vs services or you can talk about Ordinary Goods vs Veblen Goods, where Demand goes _up_ as price rises eg expensive luxury goods.

Here's another way to carve up Goods:

1. Excludable vs Non-Excludable, which means to what degree a good/service can be limited to a relevant group eg to paying customers. Some examples:

    a) Over-the-air TV vs cable TV. The former is nearly impossible to limit to paying customers (short of installing some sort of limiter into literally every antenna sold) while the latter is relatively easily limited by just cutting the connection to a given house.  
    b) Your romantic love or your parenting are easy to Exclude others from and limit to only those you deem appropriate.  
    c) The BO of someone on your bus is Non-Excludable (unfortunately), so everyone gets a snoot-full.

2. Rivalrous vs Non-Rivalrous, which is whether there's a Rivalry between one person's consumption and another's. It's a (convoluted) way of saying you can't have your cake and eat it, too. Examples:

    a) A shawarma is Rivalrous. If I consume this delicious shawarma, you can't have it and if you consume it, I can't have it.  
    b) A song is Non-Rivalrous. We can both download the song and "Consume" it and it's still out there for everyone else to enjoy.

Now we can make a 2 x 2 matrix:

|               | Excludable    | Non-Excludable
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------
| Rivalrous     | Private Goods | Common-Pool Resources
| Non-Rivalrous | Club Goods    | Public Goods

> Private Goods include food, clothing, parking spaces, etc.
> 
> Common-Pool Resources including fish stocks, timber, coal, etc.
> 
> Club Goods include cinemas, gyms, satellite/cable TV, public transport, etc.
> 
> Public Goods include this essay, over-the-air TV, open-source software, roads, national defense (or fire services, if you want something less martial--your neighbour can't get fire protection while you do), etc.

You're clever, so you've probably started categorising the goods & services you enjoy already and noticed that there's certain Business Models that show up frequently. Let's generalise "Business Models" to "production & consumption models" (so we're not only talking about private/corporate production) and you'll start noticing certain patterns:

* Private Goods generally don't have ads, other than a logo on the packaging/outside, while
* Club Goods and Public Goods often have ads on/in them to subsidise production costs when privately provided and/or they're funded by a subscription fee paid by everyone (ie taxes) when publicly provided.
* Public Goods are often free at point of purchase (PoP) eg radio stations or parks or podcast episodes.

## Why the internet is recreating TV and radio

This is why the internet has ended up reinventing TV and radio in their ad-filled glory despite apparently different formats like podcasts, YouTube, Netflix, etc. Here's how:

Let's go back to the beginning of radio and say you were starting a radio station.
It costs money (ie not radio airtime) to produce radio content and to run the station, so how are you going to generate that?

* You could try to find a generous patron and/or say "fuck it" and leave running a radio station to those well-off enough that they can foot the bill as a hobby.
* You could charge people to listen, maybe by requiring a special antenna for just your radio's frequency. As a customer I'd say "fuck you!" cause I'd rather get the radio set that allows me to listen to a hundred other stations rather than your special one.

So you're probably going to be looking at the following:

* You could beg for donations from listeners.
* You could convince the public, by way of the government, to give a cut of their annual subscription to their society (ie taxes) to support you (eg grants or public ownership).
* You could see if someone wants to pay you for airtime and through that, sell off the attention of your listenership.

I suspect you can think of radio stations with all three models and, certainly, podcasts with those. The ad-supported model is the most common, partly cause it's self-reinforcing/sustainable so it gets an "unbalanced" share very quickly cause it just grows the most vs the other two.

That's what we're seeing play out right now in the video streaming space. Initially, VCs were willing to bankroll Netflix and subsidise the price to lock in a large number of monthly subscribers they could earn monopoly profits on. But two things have happened:

1. Turns out Netflix subscribers are not particularly loyal and enough of us are willing to endure a minute of ads in order to pay less/watch free over at YouTube, Pluto TV, Twitch, etc.
2. The competitive landscape has changed and Netflix is no longer the only game in town. Other companies that own their own back catalogues of beloved shows (eg Star Trek or…_everything_ Disney owns) have put out their own streaming services instead of licensing it all to Netflix.

So we're just gonna see ad-supported streaming services come to dominate, recreating TV of old.

Of course, there is still a space for a premium customer base that is willing to pay "full" price up-front not to have ads (or just less intrusive ones) in Club/Public Goods arenas, like HBO in the cable space eg:

* Financial Times has survived the death of the news industry just fine, selling for over USD$1 billion a few years ago.
* SiriusXM has survived the internet and the death of radio just fine.
* Tidal seems to be doing ok in the music streaming wars, though this is a very active space.
* Amazon seems to be the only one making real money in the ebook space.
* Bloomberg terminals continue to make a shit ton of money despite the firehose of free information on the internet.

You'll notice that these are all arenas that target the people who are so well-off that the price required is a rounding error and they value their time more.

## "… what's all this got to do with Star Trek?"

Both the replicators-leading-to-post-scarcity and "you wouldn't download a car" line make a category error between the quadrants in the table above. They assume they can treat Private Goods as Public Goods.

The problem is Private Goods don't go away even if you have perfect, instantaneous replicators because:

1. Private Goods are required to make the Public Goods ie the car designer needs to eat food or, ultimately, a human's finite _time_.
2. Once the car/mousse chocolate is made, it's a Private Good and will obey the rules of Private Goods. If it's a consumable/sufficiently disposable, maybe it'll get ads put it each time it's made eg a new ad printed on the pita every time I replicate a shawarma (unless I subscribe to the ad-free plan for $5.99 a month!)

"Ok but replication will be essentially free, because the cost of energy is basically nil and can be transformed into matter at will".

So, it'll be treated like things that are essentially-free-but-not-quite in our society. Eg I pay a subscription cost for all the water I can drink. Yes, the water is metered but the vast majority of my payment goes into upkeep of the _infrastructure_ to get me the water cause Toronto doesn’t pay for water rights.

In ST, as long as that energy needs to be transported (requiring Private Goods), as long as replicators need to be repaired, and ultimately as long as people's time is required, there will some need for a yard-stick to measure the Opportunity Cost of all the other things that could be done with those same resources ie money (or you can call it "replicator rations", if you prefer).

As Ken Arrow put it, "the Enterprise is still scarce".

Money doesn't magically disappear from the equation, especially when things are _almost_ free (but not quite).

Here's the real punchline, though:

I already have a replicator.

It's a bunch of machines called China or India or Taiwan and, while it's not instant, I can press a few buttons on a computer interface and as many Private Goods as I want are delivered right to my home, a lot of them the next day.

In fact, as people/societies get wealthier, a smaller and smaller proportion of their income is spent on hard goods and more and more is spent on other people's time ie services or hand-made or otherwise "premium" goods.

## I'm a dumb ape with a dumb rock

Human sentimentality is another reason why post-scarcity won't be ushered in by a replicator. To explain what I mean, I have a confession:

I have a 1.5" round stone I've moved from place to place for almost a decade. It's not a special stone--not even one of the shiny ones us dumb apes seem to like. It looks like any of a million stones you would find on a beach.

In fact, that's where it came from--a beach. I had a lovely beach day years ago with my Ex (the capital indicates the weight of the relationship, not an economics term). As the sun was setting, she found a stone that she thought looked cool and gave it to me.

I laughed, thinking "what does she want me to do with this rock?"

She was hurt.  
I felt bad.  
So, I put into my pocket.

Now it lives in the box of memorabilia designated for our relationship, which has been over for most of a decade now. I can't actually remember which beach we were at nor anything else about that particular beach day. The whole memory could be--and probably is--confabulated, especially with my recent cognitive issues.

But I can't let go of this dumb rock cause I'm a dumb ape and form dumb attachments to dumb things.

Even if you offered me a hundred dollars to replace it with another _absolutely identical_ rock, I wouldn't take the deal because it's not Numerically Identical, as philosophers call it--think serial numbers on identical manfactured goods. (Bump that to $500 and I'd have to think about it--I'm pretty sentimental but not _that_ much more sentimental than I am pragmatic.)

By the way, that's why I think _Deep Space 9_ is the best Trek. Some dumb apes settled down on a _completely arbitrary_ planet and formed an insurrection--the Maquis--rather than give it up, even though there are so many planets each individual could have their own damn planet all to themselves.

## "Ok smart guy so what will end scarcity?"

idk.

Strong AI?

Uploading our consciousnesses to a virtual environment (that then doesn't require level/quest grinding just to get shiny hats to keep the servers running)?
