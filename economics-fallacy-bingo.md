I've to admit to a petty vice. I'm not proud of it but I do indulge it. In my defense, I've had to give up my usual vices—booze and other drugs, women, going outside, etc.—so I've to find new ones (or give up vice itself—ha!)

My vice is what Joseph Heath talks about in the introduction to _Filthy Lucre_ (aka _Economics Without Illusions_), my fav intro to economics:

> There are two unfortunate consequences of all this. First, most people on the left are incapable of spotting the garbage arguments that are routinely trotted out by conservatives in support of their views. For example, a common argument made against reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to point out that doing so would decrease the rate of growth, and that since growth creates employment, fighting climate change will cause unemployment. This is what’s called a non sequitur—an argument in which the premise fails to provide any reason whatsoever for believing the conclusion. Yet environmentalists respond to this argument not by laughing and pointing their finger at the person who made it, but by adducing some other set of considerations (“But what about the benefits of avoiding climatic instability?” or “What about the jobs that will be created developing new, green technology?”).
> 
> As a result, “economics” winds up serving as a magic hat, allowing people on the right to pull out support for any policy that they happen to like, even when it doesn’t follow from any coherent set of economic principles. (The best, and by far the most common, is the suggestion that tax cuts “stimulate” the economy. I sometimes wonder if economists who encourage this misconception—as a convenient fiction, simply because they don’t like taxes—ever lie awake at night feeling guilty about the setback they are helping to inflict on the cause of economic literacy.)

So, sometimes I'll trawl through the right-leaning sites and spot some economic fallacies purely for the petty joy of pointing and laughing. I rarely get through the front page without finding at least one.

This is an opinion piece—little better than a blog, but still published by the NP—which gets both the theory wrong and the history wrong.

FFS! Right-wingers love the aesthetic of economics but, like with paintballers wearing camo armour actually made of cardboard, it's just a headcanon/cosplay/LARP.

For anyone who's not an econ nerd:

1. The theory:

Telecom is an arena with massive Network Effects so it tends towards Natural Monopoly, like water delivery, power delivery, sewage, Facebook and other social media, train tracks, roads, etc.

That's why you see a lot of monopolies in those areas, whether they're publicly owned or privately owned (and the case is made for public ownership/regulation because monopolies are a Market Failure where a well-functioning competitive market can't be organised).

Compare that to, say, dog walking. It's a million individual/small providers instead. There's no monopolies in dog walking (or even large companies) cause there's no Network Effects and there's no real scalable elements that benefit from getting larger, not even accounting/revenue collection.

So "more competition" isn't a panacea in arenas with Natural Monopolies cause even if you introduce more competition, it'll just converge to the Equilibrium of an extremely small number of players within a few years. Not to mention that the incumbents will use their monopoly profits to buy any new competition out or just create the illusion of competition.

2. The history:

We already tried this experiment and THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED!

Wind (now Freedom) was founded by an Egyptian telecom mogul. Now it's owned by whoever-the-fuck incumbent; I think it was recently sold to pave the way for the Roger-Shaw merger.

And all the current incumbents own "fighter brands" so they can hand-puppet competition so they don't get hit with anti-trust suits.

So, what's the solution?

The ideal outcome from both an economics—both left and right Neoclassical school—and centre-left political economy perspective is what, for example, the UK has:

The component that's prone to Natural Monopoly (the towers/lines) are owned publicly through British Telecom and the portion that allows a well-functioning competitive market to be organised (the end-delivery) is privately handled, so any company can step forward and resell the capacity and handle all the customer service and stuff. They've got world-class telecom services and much lower prices.

We kinda have that in some regions in Canada, largely where the big telcos didn't see a big enough market and neglected them eg TBayTel. Unfortunately, building out a new publicly owned infrastructure or buying out an existing infrastructure is gonna cost way more than the public is willing to pay, especially the anti-tax hardliners who would rather pay $2 more for private provision than $1 more in tax (and force the rest of us to, as well).

Either way, "more competition" is completely—comically—economically illiterate in this situation. Competition is being treated like a magic spell rather than an idea with ~250 years of arguments and empirical work on why and—more importantly—_when_ it works.
