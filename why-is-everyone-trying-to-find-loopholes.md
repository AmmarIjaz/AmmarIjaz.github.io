Why is Everyone Trying to Find Loopholes?
=========================================

The answer to all your physical distancing loophole questions is, "No."

But why are intelligent and caring people who accept the deadliness of this virus even asking these questions? I was trained in philosophy—asking why?—and psychology, so I'm doubly committed to asking, "_why_ do _people_ do things?"

Here's why this is odd to me: if this was a war or flood, no one would be asking, "is it ok to jump out to the park? I probably won't be shot by the soldiers," or, "is it ok to see my boyfriend who’s been home for two weeks? I probably won’t drown." Everyone would be hunkering down in their homes refusing to come out. So, why are people even trying to find loopholes in this particular kind of disaster?

tl;dr: I think people are asking loophole questions because a pandemic is a Collective Action Problem (CAP) with high personal costs and low personal benefits for the majority of folk, so there is an understandable and _Rational_ (narrowly construed à la economics) tendency for individuals to try to Free-Ride off everyone else staying at home, which isn't so bad if one person does it, but a terrible idea if too many people do it. Rest of this article is unpacking this dynamic.

A Collective Action Problem (CAP) occurs when—despite it being in every member's interests to act towards a common goal—individual incentives & action prevent that from happening, which creates a worse outcome for all.

Example _Aik_
-------------

Ever walk down a hallway and almost collide with someone? You both stop, both apologise—this is Canada, after all—then one of you steps to the side and you both resume walking.

D'oh! You both stepped to the right. This is now a CAP. You share a common goal (continue along with your days), but your individual attempts to do that (move to avoid colliding) paradoxically create the outcome neither of you wants (both are stopped).

No problem! You both step to the left to allow the other to pass. Uh-oh! You both stepped to the same side again. You both laugh politely and one of you indicates the side they're gonna go, so you can get out of this analogy hell.

But why doesn't this happen all the time, rather than infrequently? In The Before Times, we coordinated walking with hundreds of people a week with almost no collisions and few traffic jams.

The reason is deceptively simple: we have a society-wide agreement that almost completely eliminates this CAP—step to your right. If both of you step to _your_ individual right sides, there's no slapstick collision nor an infinite stepping-to-the-same-side loop.

Exercise for the reader: what's going on when a call drops, then you both try to call each other back and both get the busy signal? What's the common good? What's the individual action preventing it? What simple rule would eliminate that CAP?

Example _Tho_
-------------

Let's take a more complex, classic example called the Tragedy of the Commons, which pretty much explains every major concept in Collective Action Problems. So, once you grok it, you'll be able to easily learn most of CAP/game theory and understand why climate change/global warming hasn't been solved already.

Imagine you are part of a village of shepherds. You all graze your sheep on a common grassland. All of you agree to only graze your sheep for 6 hours a day, because if everyone does more than that, the sheep will start eating into the roots of the grass, thus killing it and destroying the commons for everyone.

No problem! You're all smart folk who see the wisdom in obeying that rule and start your work week.

But! You start hearing about Romesh grazing his sheep a _little_ longer every day; maybe just ten minutes longer. From his perspective: he has a benefit (his sheep get a little plumper) but little cost ("just ten minutes longer isn't going to kill the commons").

He's Cheating/Defecting from the six-hours-max rule. In addition, the benefits are Privatized/Internalized and the costs are Publicized/Externalized, so Romesh, being a little bit ambitious about feeding his family well this month, isn't too bothered.

You think: maybe it's just a mistake. We all agreed to the rule but there's no real consequences, punishments, or fines. Ten minutes longer isn't really a huge deal anyway, and it's not worth calling the entire council of shepherds together, especially since no one else is doing anything about it. Besides, you don't wanna be known as a busybody putting a stopwatch on everyone. So, you let it slide.

Then comes market day. Romesh's sheep are noticeably plumper and fetch a higher price than all the other shepherds. Next week, you hear of another shepherd who's letting their sheep graze for an extra ten minutes. Then another, then another, and then another.

Soon, you're the only one not doing it and your sheep are looking sorry compared to everyone else's. So you figure if everyone else is doing it, and the commons seems to be fine, you may as well get your extra ten minutes, too. Your sheep sell for higher than they've sold before at the next market day.

After that market day, Sarah starts staying out a little longer—an extra fifteen minutes a day—and her sheep sell for more than everyone else. Now everyone else feels compelled to go up to six hours and fifteen minutes just to keep up.

Crap! The commons are starting to show some signs of damage.

You have to start grazing your sheep for 7 hours now because the grass is getting patchier and it takes longer for your sheep to get the same amount of food. Besides, if the commons is going down anyway, you may as well get your sheep plumper, before everyone else does and completely destroys the commons.

Now everyone else is also grazing their sheep for seven hours, then eight, then nine, thereby accelerating the demise of the commons. Now you're all locked into a kind of CAP called a Race to the Bottom (aka an Arms Race). At some point, the commons Tips (à la The Tipping Point) and becomes barren.

Here's the thing though: who's at fault? If only everyone had stuck to the 6-hour agreement, the commons would be lush and enjoyable for decades, but the common grasslands are now destroyed within a year, for no one to be able to use. But, it's tough to blame any _one_ person, even Romesh. Even though he was the first, neither he nor any _one_ person destroyed the commons by letting their sheep graze just ten minutes longer. 

Bringing it together
--------------------

So, that's the _structure_ of the Tragedy of the Commons CAP: a common good and uneven positive vs negative incentives for individuals, in particular benefits are Private (plumper sheep for me) while costs are Public (commons is degraded just a tiny bit).

What's this mean for us? A pandemic is a Tragedy of the Commons CAP, where the commons is everyone's health ("public health"). We've all agreed to a society-wide lockdown and strict physical distancing when we do have to leave our homes for essential reasons, like the shepherds agreed to a six-hour rule.

But, in a society-wide lock-down, any single individual's cost-benefit calculus looks like this:
Costs: High. Loneliness, anxiety, depression, and loss of most of the things that make a life worth living, especially if you've lost your job/income.
Benefits: Low (for the majority). Especially if you're young and likely to shrug off the virus, the benefits are mostly for other people ("Externalized")—to not be a vector and give it to someone who might give it to someone who might give it to someone who might die from it.

Because the benefits are mainly for other people and largely invisible—especially to those of us who think we don't know elderly or at-risk people—it's easy to allow a certain amount of rationalisation to creep in.

Obviously, almost no one thinks to themselves, "the benefits are Externalized, Diffuse, and improbable, so I should Defect from the physical distancing guidelines and go see my boyfriend", except perhaps economists, game theorists, and weirdo phil/psych folk like me.

They're more likely to use a rationalisation of this type: "It can't be so bad to see one person, especially if they've been physical distancing for weeks, too. It's very unlikely I'll get it and even if I do, I can probably shrug it off. I'll just avoid any old people I know and it'll probably be fine."

So, that person decides to Free-Ride off everyone else's adherence to the physical distancing guidelines and Defects.

They're not exactly wrong—_one_ person going to see another person isn't going to Tip (à la The Tipping Point) us into Italy territory, just like _one_ person grazing their sheep an extra ten minutes won't destroy the commons. Neither will twenty. To be honest, no one knows how many "slots" we have before things become things get apocalyptic.

So, in the very narrow sense that economists use the word, this is a Rational strategy, which basically just means being self-interested and responding to your incentives.

It is, however, immoral.

The problem starts when many individual people rationalise their decision in different, often unique ways to Free-Ride off everyone else's adherence and Defect. If too many people do it, we become Italy.

In addition, each Defector generates a Negative Externality (fancy word for "side-effect") by making those of us who are following physical distancing guidelines feel deeply envious and like suckers for following the rules while they're having fun in the park.

There's another cognitive bias—for lack of a better term—at work here: like traffic, we have a hard time understanding that we _are_ the pandemic. It's existential crisis-inducing that we can cause death to others, especially unintentionally.

Humans are the copper wire that the virus flows through. If I’m properly grounded, the current will pass through me and I may survive just fine, but if I’m holding hands with a loved one who's not, they'll die. Or if they're holding hands with another person, who's holding hands with another, they'll die. We have to break the current—the long chain of transmission—by staying home, unless absolutely necessary.

Getting Personal
----------------

I don't want to come off as holier-than-thou, judging those who engage in Foolishness.

I am suffering. Immensely. 

Despite all the jokes about being forced to stay home and watch Netflix, this is very, very hard. I haven't had a hug in three months, nor a face-to-face conversation with anyone I know. I've left the house seven or eight times since March 12th.

Loneliness has re-triggered childhood trauma. My OCD is getting worse. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time and I thought I knew it as intimately as a lover, but I've experienced new, darker depths of depression. I've hated myself more than I've ever experienced before.

I'm also risking developing new mental illnesses, in particular agoraphobia.

For me—like everyone—other people are not a nice-to-have. Loneliness taps into the physical pain systems.

Loneliness hurts. It hurts like your hand getting crushed; your finger sliced open. It has long-term negative consequences including premature death.

And the solution is so simple, so easy. A drink with a friend, or an evening with a partner. I've had my fair share of rationalisations: "I've been in social isolation for months now. If I just wait a couple of weeks after my last grocery trip, then have someone over for an night, then we both quarantine for two weeks after, that'll almost completely eliminate the likelihood of spreading this, even if we're both completely asymptomatic, right? Right?"

But it's not right. All of our society's slots for not physical distancing are filled up by essential workers, those who are unable to physically distance (eg the homeless, those in prison, the deeply mentally ill, etc.), and those who are unwilling to physically distance. There's no room for me to see anyone.

These are all enormous sacrifices I'm making for the greater good; to save other people's lives. Since I know few older people directly, it's likely the life of a stranger. But I've never felt so connected to every other person in my city or my world.

Please join me in saving lives. Stay home.
